genefer22 22.11.4 => genefer 22.12.2

Caveats
 - genefer22 is now genefer version year.month.release
 - if the validation fails then exit code is EXIT_CHILD_FAILED (was BOINC_SUCCESS)

New Features
 - Gerbicz-Li error checking of the proof task (-c)
 - new CPU transform for n <= 16. The CPU limit is b_max = 2G.

Fixes
 - double close on file I/O error
 - read old checkpoint if the current one is invalid
 - send Boinc trickle
 - warning "#threads > 64"
 - warning "implementation is not valid", was an error

Improvements
- success-failed-aborted logic is propagated, exit(0) were removed
